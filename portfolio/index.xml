      <description>Feature Selection Choosing a coffee is fundamentally an exercise in prediction. Presumptive coffee drinkers are presented with an onslaught of variables describing a coffee&amp;rsquo;s origins, flavors, sent, texture and roasting processes. The combination of variables can rapidly increases to the point of becoming overwhelming.

Put simply predicting whether a coffee will be good or bad is balance between considering to much information and not enough.</description>

      <description>What are your plans for the weekend? While it is easy to imagine that Americans spend their weekends differently, this is a challenging question to empirically validate.
Describing the average Americanâ€™s weekend plans is an easy exercise in descriptive statistics. On average, the typical American spends 10 hours sleeping, six hours socializing and relaxing, two hours on household activities and one hour eating and drinking. The picture of the average weekend is shown in the plot below.</description>
